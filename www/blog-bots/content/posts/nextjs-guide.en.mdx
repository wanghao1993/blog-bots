# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. Let's explore why it's become the go-to framework for modern web development.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several key advantages:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improved SEO and initial load performance
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
3. **API Routes**: Build your backend right in your Next.js app
4. **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing based on the file system
5. **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization out of the box

## Getting Started

First, create a new Next.js application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Key Features

### App Router

The new App Router in Next.js 13+ provides:

- React Server Components
- Streaming
- Nested layouts
- Loading UI
- Error handling

### Example Component

```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
      <p>Building modern web apps has never been easier.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. Use the `<Image>` component for optimized images
2. Implement dynamic imports for code splitting
3. Leverage ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
4. Use server components by default

## Conclusion

Next.js provides everything you need to build production-ready web applications. With its powerful features and great developer experience, it's the perfect choice for your next project!

Happy coding! 🚀
